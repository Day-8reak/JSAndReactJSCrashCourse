    // Data types:
//Undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol (immutable primitive object), number, object
var myName = "Max"; //Variables initialized with var, no need to specify datatype
myName = 8; // Can change data types

//Can also declare variables:

let friendName = "Khoi is juicy"; // Only declared in the local scope
const greeting = "Hello!"; // Is immutable, can't change anymore



    //Storing values
var a; //Declaring variable

a = 7; // Assigning variable, can be done in the same line as declaring as shown before


// If we ever print a variable onto the console that's yet
// To have been assigned a value, then we get a null output



    //Concatenation and addition 
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

//Adding and subtractingstrings and shit
a = a + 5;
b = b - 10;
var c  = a * 10;
var d = c / 5;
c = c + " goat";
//Incrementing and decremeing: (add/subtract 1)
c++;
c--;



    //Declaration Vs Assignments
var CAPSMATTER;
capsMatter = 10; // This is a different variable from the previous declaration



    //Math
//Math is pretty much the same as in any other programming language
